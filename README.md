This code uses the speech_recognition library to listen to audio input from a microphone and convert it to text. It then uses the pyttsx3 library to convert the text to speech and play it back. The listen() function listens to audio input and returns the recognized text. The speak() function takes a text input and converts it to speech. The main() function runs an infinite loop that listens to audio input, prints the recognized text, and plays the text as speech. The loop can be exited by saying "exit".

This code creates a basic speech-to-text and text-to-speech application that can be used to create an inclusive user interface. With this code as a foundation, you can add more advanced features and functions to the application.
